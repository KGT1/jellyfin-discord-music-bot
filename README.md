## Getting Started
You'll need a Discord Application for this Bot to work, as you will host it yourself.

[Generate an Api and bot here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/). 

Click New Application.

The Name of the application will be the bot's name.

Go to the Bot tab.

Generate the bot, and grab the token. Also, recommend making the bot private.

Next, join a voice channel and connect your bot with ?summon. This will connect your bot to the voice channel you're in and will create the device profile in Jellyfin.
